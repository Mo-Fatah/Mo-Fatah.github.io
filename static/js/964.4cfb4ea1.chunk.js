I am an Outreachy Alumni with the [Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/). I am flexible to dive into any tech stack, but I usually enjoy learning more about Backend Systems and Infrastructure. I also have a great interest in some new technologies like Rust, WebAssembly and WASI.\n\n# Some history\n\nWhen I started my Production Engineering Degree, I took my first programming course in Python (Programming 1), but I wasn't interested at all in programming back then. After that, I took [Udacity's Data Analyst NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). Surprisngly, what interested me was the programming part of Data analysis, not the statistical part. After that I started my journey to learn Computer Science on my own besides my college, and my main source was the [Open Source Society University(OSSU)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I started with OSSU's curriculum, and it was a really long, educational and challenging journy.<br /> \nI started with[MIT's introduction to CS](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/), then I studied Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Database Systems, Algorithms and Data Structures, and FullStack Web Development.<br /> Phew! Long journey! However, very rewarding!\nAfter that, I started my journey as a Software Engineer!\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,m=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},((0,r.Z)(e),e));return(0,c.jsx)(s.rU,(0,a.Z)({},t))};t.default=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(u.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Mohamed Abdelfatah",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(s.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(o(),{source:l,renderers:{Link:m},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
