# Intro

I am a self-taught Software Engineer. I am an Outreachy Alumni with the [Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/). I am flexible to dive into any tech stack, but I usually enjoy learning more about Backend Systems and Infrastructure. I also have a great interest in some new technologies like Rust, WebAssembly and WASI.

# Some history

When I started my Production Engineering Degree, I took my first programming course in Python (Programming 1), but I wasn't interested at all in programming back then. After that, I took [Udacity's Data Analyst NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). Surprisngly, what interested me was the programming part of Data analysis, not the statistical part. After that I started my journey to learn Computer Science on my own besides my college, and my main source was the [Open Source Society University(OSSU)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I started with OSSU's curriculum, and it was a really long, educational and challenging journy.<br /> 
I started with[MIT's introduction to CS](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/), then I studied Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Database Systems, Algorithms and Data Structures, and FullStack Web Development.<br /> Phew! Long journey! However, very rewarding!
After that, I started my journey as a Software Engineer!
